\section{Haptics Overview}
Computer Haptic Feedback is the research field that deals with the need to be able to digitalize the human sense of touch and reproduce it.
The main reason for this is the complexity of the human sense of touch which we still donâ€™t understand fully.
The human tactile sensing system can \textbf{measure specific properties of materials}, such as temperature, texture, force, friction, hardness and viscoelasticity, \textbf{through physical contact} between the human skin and the object.
Even the \textbf{changing state of the interaction}, such as gravitational and inertial effects, can be perceived through the sense of touch.
The sense of touch is based on the somatosensory system, which is a complex system of nerve endings and touch receptors in the skin. The somatosensory system is
composed of four main types of receptors, each one is specialized in detecting a specific type of stimulus: \textbf{mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, nociceptors and proprioceptors}.
Mechanoreceptors are the most important receptors for haptic feedback, as they are responsible for detecting vibration and pressure.
Their sensitivity is limited in both the frequency and amplitude of vibrations they can detect. The force amplitude limit also depends on the constant pressure applied to the skin.
