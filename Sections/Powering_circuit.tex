\section{Control Unit}
Using coils to produce magnetic fields of usable intensity requires running them at pretty high currents.
This is because the magnetic field strength is proportional to the current flowing through the coil.
The goal of our device is to generate vibrations at different frequencies so we need to develop an AC-capable power supply.
Standard AC circuits are usually built to generate only low-current signals (in the order of tens of $mA$) but we need to generate signals in the order of $1A$.
For this reason, the control unit we are going to use has in its signal path a power amplifier based on power op-amps. Power op-amps have an integrated power stage that allows them to deliver high currents with a wide frequency bandwidth.
The signal can be generated through a microcontroller with a built-in DAC, in our case we tested the system with an ESP32 board.
