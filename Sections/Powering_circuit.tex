\section{Device Control Unit}
Using coils to produce magnetic fields of usable intensity requires running them at relatively \textbf{high currents}.
This is because the magnetic field strength is proportional to the current flowing through the coil.
The goal of our device is to generate vibrations at \textbf{different frequencies} so we need to develop an \textbf{AC-capable power supply}.
Standard AC circuits are usually built to generate only \textbf{low-curren}t signals (in the order of \textbf{tens of $mA$}) but we need to generate signals in the order of \textbf{$1A$}.
For this reason, the control unit we are going to use has in its signal path a \textbf{power amplifier} based on \textbf{power op-amps}. Power op-amps have an integrated power stage that allows them to deliver \textbf{high currents} with a \textbf{wide frequency bandwidth}.
The signal can be generated through a \textbf{microcontroller} with a built-in DAC, in our case we tested the system with an \textbf{ESP32 board}.
