    This thesis aims to explore the use of flexible PCB coils in haptic applications to create realistic touch sensations. Current piezo actuators, commonly used for generating vibration cues, have limited low-frequency response and lack of flexibility, which are crucial for realistic and wearable haptic interfaces. Flexible PCB coils, capable of producing low-frequency vibrations and withstanding bending stresses, offer a potential solution. The thesis will first create a mathematical model of the force transmission chain of a voice actuator-style haptic device created with flexible coils, considering also how the human finger reacts to its stimuli. It will then present the necessary electronics for driving the device and conclude with the design and testing of prototypes to evaluate the technology's potential and limitations.
